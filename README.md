Decentraland Game Jam 2022: 

Grab an item and feed it to the cat
The cat will reward you for bringing items it desires.
It indicates what it wants in the thought bubble.
For wrong items it will remove points from your score.

Never full! Never endeing fun :D

The game items (cat food) are stored and handled on a firebase server, so it stays in sync with other players.

Test the scene:
[Play me on test realm](https://hungry-cat.herokuapp.com/?realm=v1%7Ehungry-cat.herokuapp.com&renderer-branch=master&ENABLE_WEB3=&position=0%2C1 )

If you don't see fruits in the sand than reload the game…
